# Java_Challenge_One

Interplanetary Travel Simulation This repository contains a Java-based simulation of interplanetary travel, developed as part of a challenge from the Dev Senior Academy. The project focuses on enhancing programming logic, promoting collaborative teamwork, and deepening understanding of software development processes.

## üöÄ Project Description

This is an interactive space travel simulator that allows users to plan and simulate journeys to different planets in our solar system. The program provides options to select destinations, choose spacecraft, and calculate travel details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Planet Selection**: Choose from multiple destinations:
  - Mars (225 million km from Earth)
  - Jupiter (628 million km from Earth)
  - Saturn (1426 million km from Earth)

- **Spacecraft Options**: Select from different types of spacecraft:
  - Explorer Ship (20,000 km/h)
  - Heavy Cargo Ship (15,000 km/h)
  - Maximum Speed Ship (30,000 km/h)

- **Interactive Menu System**: User-friendly console interface with colored text output
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling for user inputs
- **Travel Simulation**: Basic simulation of interplanetary travel

## üîß Technical Implementation

The project is structured with the following key components:

- **Main Application (App.java)**:
  - Contains the core logic and menu system
  - Implements user input handling
  - Manages the simulation flow

- **Key Features**:
  - Static arrays for storing planet and spacecraft data
  - Scanner implementation for user input
  - ANSI color codes for enhanced console output
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Modular design with separate methods for different functionalities

## üíª Code Structure

The code is organized into several main methods:

1. `main()`: Controls the main program flow and menu loop
2. `showMenu()`: Displays the main menu options
3. `selectPlanet()`: Handles planet selection logic
4. `selectShip()`: Manages spacecraft selection
5. `iniciarSimulacion()`: Controls the simulation process

## üéØ Current Status

The project currently implements:
- Basic menu system
- Planet and spacecraft selection
- Input validation
- Colorized console output
- Basic simulation framework

## üîú Planned Features

- Resource calculation system
- Detailed travel statistics
- Enhanced simulation details
- Additional planets and spacecraft options
- More interactive elements during simulation

## üö¶ How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the Java files
4. Run the App class
5. Follow the on-screen menu options

## üé® User Interface

The program features a color-coded console interface:
- Green text for success messages and headers
- Red text for error messages
- Blue text for informational messages
- Bold text for important options and prompts
